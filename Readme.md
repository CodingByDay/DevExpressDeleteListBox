# How to show the delete button when an end-user hovers the mouse over the ListBox item


<p>This example demonstrates how to show the delete button when an end-user hovers the mouse over the ListBox item. The main idea is to handle the DrawItem event, which is used for drawing a custom view of an item. The redraw region of ListBox rises during the mouse move. ButtonEditPainter is used for drawing the delete button.</p>
